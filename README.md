## bono
#### For the greater good

---
Bono is a federated mobile app that helps people get active within their community with volunteering and organizations. 

This is the frontend repository - written with React Native.

Some roadmap goals are:
 - Ease of setup. Users should be able to setup a local Bono instance with basic tech skills and inexpensive hardware.
 - Federated. Bono instances should be able to communicate with each other, enabling effective clusters that span larger areas.
 - Community focus. Bono is designed around a central map to drive focus towards community.
